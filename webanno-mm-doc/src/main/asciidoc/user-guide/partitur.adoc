== WebAnno MM Guide

=== Set up your project

For this example setup we will create a new project and add a document with the associated movie and audio resources to make use of the partitur view of webanno.
After this setup we will be able to annotate our document and at the same time watch the movie or hear the audio to create better annotations!

==== Create a new project

We have uploaded the document as well as the associated resources. What is left to do is creating those associations / links.

. In the „Media Resource“-Window select a media file
. In the „Document Resource“-Window select a document

After opening the project the annotation view should open. As this guide is about the partitur view of webanno we won’t go through the details of this view. Moreover, in case you already used webanno you should be familiar with this view.

Still, there is one important thing to mention. You should have noticed little titled „Play“-Buttons above the documents text. These buttons correspond to the sections in your document.

==== The partitur view

To open the partitur view you need to press one of those mentioned buttons. It is helpful to note that by pressing the button you will jump to the associated section in the partitur view.

To jump back to the annotation view you can click any section name displayed in the partitur view.

==== Explanation of the partitur view

[.float-group]

The partitur view consists of 4 components:

. The media player. Here you can watch or listen media resources depending on the type. It is possible to use videos or audios as a media resource.
. The annotated document view. Here you can see the document text with their annotations displayed as a table. Each column represents a segment in the document whereas each row represents an annotation type for a speaker. The rows are orderd by the speakername.
. The Tier display. Here you can select which annotation types should be shown in the document view. Selecting or deselecting annotation types will update the document view.
. The settings menu. Here you can change some preferences.

This section ends with this explanation. By now you should be able to navigate between annotation view and partitur view and know the basic functionality of the partitur view.

=== Further tips & tricks

==== Media resource jumps

As you already know you can watch or listen to the documents associated media resource in the partitur view. You can even jump to every section in the document view to hear the exact phrase you are reading.

To do this just press the little play button in the header row of the section you are reading.

==== One table view

[.float-group]
--
.setting up the one table view

As default the text and annotations in the document view are divided into many tables so they don’t exceed a certain character limit. You can adjust this character limit in the settings panel.

However, by setting the character limit to zero, the whole document text and annotations will be displayed in one table.

==== Switching between media resources

[.float-group]

In case you associated more than one media resource with a document you can switch between those media resources in the settings panel.

Just choose the media resource you want to display and hit the „Save“-Button.
